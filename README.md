# Project Motivation
This project evaluates a range of supervised learning algorithms to train a model that can be used to identify potential donors to a fictitious charity.  

Using census data, these models identify residents that are likely to earn more than $50,000 per year, enabling the charity to optimise the investment associated with requesting these donations by targeting the people who are most likely to donate. The census data fields that have the most predictive power are also identified.  

# File Descriptions
The notebook contains the code required to explore and prepare the census data for modeling.  It also contains the code required to train, evaluate and tune a range of supervised learning algorithms, and to examine the census data feature importance.  

# Installations
This notebook was developed using the library versions below:
* python: 3.7.6
* pandas: 1.0.1
* numpy: 1.16.4
* matploltlib: 3.1.2
* scikit-learn: 0.22.1

# Acknowledgments
Thank you to Udacity for designing this project as part of the Data Science Nanodegree.
